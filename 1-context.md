Computers as Graphical Tools
============================

Alan Kay’s interest in computers began during a two-week programming course by IBM as part of his Air Force training. Soon after, in 1966,  he finished his Bachelor’s degree at the University of Colorado and entered into a Computer Science Masters program at the University of Utah, where he also undertook his doctorate[TTC].  During the Masters he was introduced to Ivan Sutherland’s 1963 PhD thesis on Sketchpad, a computational drawing system[HCIH5]. Two years later Sutherland joined the computer graphics lab at UoU and Kay worked under him.

Sketchpad was the first  realisation of an interactive graphical computer system, a precursor to MacPaint, leading to technology such as Adobe’s Photoshop. It used a device called a light pen to control the screen, as the computer mouse had not yet been introduced by Douglas Englebart. Sutherland was the first person to investigate digital display beyond text, but his program dealt only with drawing on the screen and not with any symbolic or icon-like representations[IC13]. However, this exposure the graphical possibilities of computers stuck with Kay and became a cornerstone of his later work.

In 1968 he completed his doctoral project ‘the FLEX machine’ alongside Ed Cheadle, incrementing upon contemporary work with a high-resolution display for animated graphics and text. He later described it as having a user interface but ‘one that repelled end users instead of drawing them closer’[UIAPV123], he also said that that ‘much of the hardware and software was successful from the standpoint of computer science state-of-the-art research, but lacked sufficient expressive power to be useful to an ordinary user’[NMR394], but it was the seeds of what became the Dynabook.

Soon after, he read Marshal McLuhan’s seminal 1964 book Understanding Media and had an epiphany about how he should be designing computers[UIAPV124].

Computers as Media
==================

Marshal McLuhan popularised the study of Media Theory with Understanding Media and the 1967 experimental publication The Medium is the Massage. McLuhan postulates that is it the medium of communication that matters, and that the content is incidental. In the first part of Understanding Media he differentiates between ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ media by the amount of participation required – ‘hot’ media such as film demands the viewer’s attention and can be passively consumed, contrasted with a ‘cold’ medium like books, which require much more conscious effort on behalf of the reader to be understood[UM?]. He espoused that it was not the type of programming on the TV or the subject of novels that was important to track cultural change, it was the modes of consumption.

McLuhan is said to have predicted the internet[findRef]. He perceived the rise of electronic media as an era-shifting cultural event, describing a ‘global village’ – geography becomes irrelevant as information can travel instantly from anywhere to anywhere[findRef].
