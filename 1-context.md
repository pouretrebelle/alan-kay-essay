Computers as Graphical Tools
============================

Alan Kay’s interest in computers began during a two-week programming course by IBM as part of his Air Force training. Soon after, in 1966,  he finished his Bachelor’s degree at the University of Colorado and entered into a Computer Science Masters program at the University of Utah, where he also undertook his doctorate[TTC].  During the Masters he was introduced to Ivan Sutherland’s 1963 PhD thesis on Sketchpad, a computational drawing system[HCIH5]. Two years later Sutherland joined the computer graphics lab at UoU and Kay worked under him.

Sketchpad was the first  realisation of an interactive graphical computer system, a precursor to MacPaint, leading to technology such as Adobe’s Illustrator. It used a device called a light pen to control the screen, as the computer mouse had not yet been introduced by Douglas Englebart. Sutherland was the first person to investigate digital display beyond text, but his program dealt only with drawing on the screen and not with any symbolic or icon-like representations[IC13]. However, this exposure the graphical possibilities of computers stuck with Kay and became a cornerstone of his later work.

In 1968 he completed his doctoral project ‘the FLEX machine’ alongside Ed Cheadle, incrementing upon contemporary work with a high-resolution display for animated graphics and text. He later described it as having a user interface but ‘one that repelled end users instead of drawing them closer’[UIAPV123], he also said that that ‘much of the hardware and software was successful from the standpoint of computer science state-of-the-art research, but lacked sufficient expressive power to be useful to an ordinary user’[NMR394], but it was the seeds of what became the Dynabook.

Soon after, he read Marshal McLuhan’s seminal 1964 book _Understanding Media_ and had an epiphany about the purpose of the computers he was designing[UIAPV124].

Computers as Media
==================

Marshal McLuhan popularised the study of Media Theory with _Understanding Media_ and the 1967 experimental publication _The Medium is the Massage_. McLuhan postulates that is it the medium of communication that matters, and that the content is incidental. In the first part of Understanding Media he differentiates between ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ media by the amount of participation required – ‘hot’ media such as film demands the viewer’s attention and can be passively consumed, contrasted with a ‘cold’ medium like books, which require much more conscious effort on behalf of the reader to be understood[UM?]. He espoused that it was not the type of programming on the TV or the subject of novels that was important to track cultural change, it was the modes of consumption.

McLuhan is said to have predicted the internet[findRef]. He perceived the rise of electronic media as an era-shifting cultural event, describing a ‘global village’ – geography becomes irrelevant as information can travel instantly from anywhere to anywhere[findRef].

In an essay Alan Kay wrote in 1989 he described his understanding of McLuhan’s thesis – ‘when he said “the medium is the message” he meant that you have to _become_ the medium if you use it’[UIAPV124]. Kay was saying that to glean meaning from a medium you have to be able to subtract the medium from the content. He allegorises this by saying that ‘it is in the nature of tools and man that learning to use tools reshapes us’[UIAPV124]. Kay had internalised that there is an inherent symbiosis between humans and anything humans use for purpose. It is with this revelation that he mentally re-classified the computer as a medium rather than a mere tool.

McLuhan theorised that the invention of the Guttenburg Press had such great cultural impact not due to its physical ability to produce books, but to its ability to change readers’ thought patterns[findRef]. Kay subscribed to this notion and believed that the same would be true for the rise of the personal computer. The paradigm of ‘computer as medium’ brings with it much greater social, political and cultural responsibility than ‘computer as tool’, and Kay recognised that decisions made in the early days of PC technology would massively propagate into the societies and cultures of the future, where computers would, inevitably, be ubiquitous.

Computers for Education
=======================

By 1968, Seymour Papert had been working with renowned developmental psychologist Jean Piaget for five years[TTC], and had in 1967 become  co-director of MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory alongside Marvin Minsky, with whom he went on to extensively collaborate[findRef]. Papert was the first person to explore how computers can be used for teaching, specifically for children.

As Papert explains in his 1980 book _Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas_, traditionally education has been based on providing information, exercises that challenge, and feedback. Papert recognised that the same model had been adopted for the use of teaching children about computers in classrooms, inasmuch as classrooms had computers at the time. He believed that computers had the ability to affect the way people think and learn, and that education using them should reflect that[MS3].

Piaget theorised that children develop different intellectual abilities in a specific order, for example simple reflexes are acquired in the first six weeks from birth, curiosity begins to develop at ages 4-7, abstract thought begins around age 11, and so on[findRef]. He simplified these results into three stages of development – kinesthetic, visual, and symbolic. Papart thought that the reason skills like calculation require deliberate teaching is due to our culture’s ‘relative poverty in materials from which the apparently “more advance” intellectual structures can be built’[MS20]. Learning mathematics could be fun and natural to children if it was presented in an engaging context, he believed that computers could be that context. With that theory and Piaget’s studies showing receptivity to dynamic, passive learning throughout childhood, Papert and his team began working on the LOGO programming language and environment.

Papert coined the term ‘Constructionism’ for this theory of discovery learning, using existing knowledge to further their understanding by developing mental models, and being _guided_ by teachers rather than being taught information explicitly. With the LOGO environment, Papert flipped the strategy of traditional teaching methods. ‘The child, even at preschool ages, is in control: The child programs the computer. And in teaching the computer how to think, children embark on an exploration of how they themselves think.’[MS19]

In that Autumn of 1968, shortly after Kay’s initial exposure to McLuhan’s work, he visited Papert’s team at MIT’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory and observed one of the earliest LOGO experiments within a school. He was struck by the radical ethos of Papert’s studies, which fitted precisely into what Kay considered the ‘computer as medium’ paradigm, because their purpose was to effect not _what_ children learn, but _how_ they learn. He writes, ‘if the computer is only a vehicle, perhaps you can wait until high school to give “driver’s ed” on it—but if it’s a medium, then it must be extended all the way into the world of the child.’[UIAPPV125] He contributed the success of LOGO as a learning environment, far beyond that of other school-taught programming languages such as BASIC, to the decision of designing a language specifically with ‘the end user’s characteristics in mind’[UIAPV125]. Papert later praised Kay and his team at Xerox PARC for aligning with his vision, saying they were ‘the only American workers on computers for children who made a clear decision that significant research could not be based on the primitive computers that were then becoming available in schools.’[MS210]

Kay’s visit to MIT made a big impression on him, it was clear that his work with computers should be grounded in psychological research. He found most of the psychologists he studied to have findings unsuitable to the progressive environment he was aiming to build around educational computing, until he came across Jerome Bruner and his 1966 book _Toward a Theory of Instruction_[UIAPV126]. Bruner built on Piaget’s studies, verifying much of his work concerning distinct developmental stages, but had alternative interpretations of how these mentalities influenced children at different ages. He distinguished them as _enactive_, _iconic_, and _symbolic_[TTI10]. _Enactive_ learning is learning through action, _iconic_ describes organising a system of visual (or otherwise sensory) representation , and _symbolic_ involves organisation of words and language. The key difference between Bruner and Piaget’s conclusions was that Bruner believed all of these mentalities existed at all stages of childhood, but in each stage the corresponding Piagetian mentality was favoured. Therefore creating a rich learning environments involves all three types of learning but with particular emphasis to the mentality favoured by their developmental stage.

Papert was responsible for convincing Kay that learning was and should be inextricably linked to user interface design, and Bruner’s model of developmental mentalities gave Kay the framework on which to base his work. It was with this in mind Kay constructed the model of ‘Doing with Images makes Symbols’. Each element of the Dynabook was designed to facilitate enactive, iconic, and symbolic learning.
