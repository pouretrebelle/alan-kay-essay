Consequences
============

I think the innovations by Alan Kay and his contemporaries at PARC up to 1977 can be synthesised into ‘making computers useful to non-programmers’. It is this ideology that carried through into the 1981 Xerox Star, the first commercially-available computer with a Graphical User Interface, icons, folders, and mouse. Despite embodying an entire decade of ground-breaking innovation the Star only sold 25 thousand units[TFT235].

However, in 1979 the investment arm of Xerox began negotiations with an up-and-coming personal computing company called Apple. They were offering $1 million for 100,000 shares, but as part of the deal some of the company’s representatives were to be given a tour of the PARC facilities and be introduced to some of their research projects. Larry Tesler, one of PARC’s more serious engineers, gave a demonstration of the Xerox Alto (precursor to the Star) to Steve Jobs, Bill Atkinson and six of their eagerly-attentive colleagues. Tesler later remarked that they were the most inquisitive visitors to ever tour PARC and more inspiring to talk to than any of his Xerox coworkers because they not only believed in the vision of the Kay-Xerox paradigm but had an urgency and determination to bring it to the public[IG79]. Several months later Tesler left PARC to begin work for Apple, after 3 years they released the Lisa [IG102], and in 1984 the first Apple Macintosh became available to the public[Superbowl].

The Macintosh was phenomenally successful, over 50,000 units had been sold within 75 days of its introduction[COAC], no doubt due to its modest size and, for comparable machines at the time, very low price (retailing at $2500). The Macintosh was the first machine to bring all of the ideas which originated at PARC to the mass market. The desktop metaphor was the perfect marketing tool because, while also explaining the potentials of the computer, it was just futuristic enough to be a liberator from corporate tedium without appearing intimidating[IC71].
