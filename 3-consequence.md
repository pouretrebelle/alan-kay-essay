User Illusion
=============

I think the innovations by Alan Kay and his contemporaries at PARC up to 1977 can be synthesised into ‘making computers useful to non-programmers’. While Kay was concretising his vision for the Dynabook, others at PARC were working towards a marketable PC using many of the Dynabook’s interface ideas. The Xerox Alto, the first computer based on a Graphical User Interface, was brought to market in 1973 and the much improved Xerox Star in 1981.

With the introduction of a _modeless_ desktop, trading in commands for mouse clicks, navigation had to be made visual. One of Kay’s protégés David Smith made the connection between the desktop metaphor and using representations of those real-life objects to denote objects on the screen while brainstorming about the idea of a computer for office workers[Pyg]. While working alongside Kay on Smalltalk, Smith also took to Bruner’s development theory and recognised that using images for navigation would improve ease of use, as iconic learning is more fundamental than symbolic/textual. Smith was the principal designer for the Star and so it shipped with an array of glyphs (later fashioned into the word ‘icons’[BD110]) featuring dog-eared documents, folders, filing cabinets, printers, in and out trays, address books, calculators, computers and more.

The problem of the icon metaphor is the same as that of the GUI as a whole, that it’s intrinsically attached to human expectations. As Kay puts it, ‘should we transfer the paper metaphor so perfectly that the screen is as hard as paper to erase and change?’[M:FW128]. The useful part of the metaphor is the aspect of familiarity, it sets a benchmark and gives the user an immediate understanding of a tool’s capabilities. Although when it comes to technology we know that the metaphor isn’t going to be accurate, it is confined by the necessity to be consistent, and it provides no indication of the tool’s capabilities _beyond_ the analogy. Members of PARC considered this an exercise in psychology, they preferred the term ‘user illusion’[Boot165] to describe the gap between what the user sees and how they should think about it. ‘User illusion’ has a much greater capacity for the transformative capabilities of computers beyond their linguistic metaphors.

Consequences
============

Despite embodying an entire decade of ground-breaking innovation the Star only sold 25 thousand units[TFT235]. However, in 1979 the investment arm of Xerox began negotiations with an up-and-coming personal computing company called Apple. They were offering $1 million for 100,000 shares, but as part of the deal some of the company’s representatives were to be given a tour of the PARC facilities and be introduced to some of their research projects. Larry Tesler gave a demonstration of the Xerox Alto to Steve Jobs, Bill Atkinson and six of their eagerly-attentive colleagues. Tesler later remarked that they were the most inquisitive visitors to ever tour PARC and more inspiring to talk to than any of his Xerox coworkers because they not only believed in the vision of the Dynabook but had an urgency and determination to bring it to the public[IG79]. Several months later Tesler left PARC to begin work for Apple, after 3 years they released the Lisa [IG102], and in 1984 the first Apple Macintosh became available to the public[Superbowl].

The Macintosh was phenomenally successful, over 50,000 units had been sold within 75 days of its introduction[COAC], no doubt due to its modest size and, for comparable machines at the time, very low price (retailing at $2500). The Macintosh was the first machine to bring all of the ideas which originated at PARC to the mass market. The desktop metaphor was the perfect marketing tool because, while also explaining the potentials of the computer, it was just futuristic enough to be a liberator from corporate tedium without appearing intimidating[IC71].
