Alan Kay’s interest in computers began during a two-week programming course by IBM as part of his Air Force training. Soon after, in 1966,  he finished his Bachelor’s degree at the University of Colorado and entered into a Computer Science Masters program at the University of Utah, where he also undertook his doctorate[TTC].  During the Masters he was introduced to Ivan Sutherland’s 1963 PhD thesis on Sketchpad, a computational drawing system[HCIH5]. Two years later Sutherland joined the computer graphics lab at UoU and Kay worked under him.

Sketchpad was the first  realisation of an interactive graphical computer system, a precursor to MacPaint, leading to technology such as Adobe’s Photoshop. Sutherland was the first person to investigate digital display beyond text, but his program dealt only with drawing on the screen and not with any symbolic or icon-like representations.
