Legacy
======

Like Seymour Papert, I believe Alan Kay’s true work to be his devotion to prioritising future-thinking, accessibility and education, and the resolution to treating the computer as a medium, which honours the computer as a cultural phenomenon rather than an engineer’s plaything. It is hard to measure the reach of these philosophies, but far easier to track the propagation of them through the artefacts of their creation.

Overlapping windows, drop-down menus, and icons, are omnipresent. Universal also are the many inventions contingent on Kay’s innovations and ideologies, I will highlight just a few. The form factor and portability of the laptop were marked by the Dynabook[Wired]. The WYSIWYG editor and cut/paste functionality, developed as the Gypsy text editor by Larry Tesler alongside Kay at PARC, relied on the modeless desktop[IC53]. With digital skeuomorphism (the art of digital design to represent real-world counterparts), a practice with origins in Bruner’s developmental models, Kay and Smith not only conceived of user interface design but the whole paradigm of how people should approach computers and think about the computer’s purpose in their life.

Alan Kay left the legacy that computers do not exist to aid us in doing less, but to enable us to do more.
