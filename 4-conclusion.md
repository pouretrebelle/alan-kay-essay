Like Seymour Papert, I believe Alan Kay’s true work to be his devotion to prioritising future-thinking, accessibility and education, and the resolution to treating the computer as a medium, which honours the computer as a cultural phenomenon rather than an engineer’s plaything. It is hard to measure the reach of these philosophies, but far easier to track the propagation of them through the artefacts of their creation.

Overlapping windows, drop-down menus, and icons, are omnipresent. Universal also are the many inventions contingent on Kay’s innovations and ideologies – the WYSIWYG editor, digital skeumorphism, the format factor of the laptop, to name a few.
