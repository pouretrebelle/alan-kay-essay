So far we’ve looked at the key media and educational philosophies that influenced Alan Kay between building the FLEX machine in 1968 and leading up to the Dynabook at Xerox PARC. Now I’d like to analyse the ‘Personal Dynamic Media’ study to evaluate how these philosophies were manifested.

The study begins by introducing the Dynabook as a machine which could be ‘owned by everyone’[PDM] and adequately powerful for anybody’s needs. It specifically introduces Smalltalk as a ‘communication system’ instead of as a programming language, emphasising that it can be used by everybody and not only those adept at programming.

The publication includes several examples of programs written in Smalltalk from applications for painting to music-making to animation to a hospital’s HR tracking. Each describes non-technical person (or group of people) having programming ideas and being able to execute them with no prior experience, including one ‘young girl’. It explains that they were greatly encouraged by the MIT Logo work to adopt children as their user community, finding their excitement for programming compelling and their execution impressive, as well as noting that the children had a true sense of accomplishment due to the ‘pictoral and auditary nature of their results’, and extended attention spans. Kay and his team proved that they could make something both simple and powerful, it having real applications for adults and children alike. It should also be noted that the ‘Doing with Images makes Symbols’ ethos appears to be successful, that the kids specifically love ‘the interactive nature of the dialogue’.

> Methods discovered in one medium provide metaphors which contribute new ways to think about notions in other media.

The computer is described as a ‘metamedium’; given that the representation or simulation of other media are satisfactory, it has the ability to _‘be all other media’_, a powerful statement. Beyond simulating other media, it has the ability to combine, compare, even meld, media together, a true tool of manipulation. The paper parallels McLuhan’s analogy of hot and cold media to differentiate between the computer and ‘paper, paint on walls, even “motion” pictures and television’, saying that their immutability and static nature pales in comparison to the _active_ nature of the new metamedium, which can respond to action. **OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT MANOVICH + POSTMODERNISM**

‘One of the goals of the Dynabook’s design is _not_ to be _worse_ than paper in any important way’. This is the basis of the paper paradigm / desktop metaphor of the previous chapter, that imitating paper is the most familiar and therefore intuitive display to non-programmers, but it would be pointless if the computer didn’t have more abilities than paper. The Dynabook is one of the earliest examples of using black text on a white background.
