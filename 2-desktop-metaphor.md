The Desktop Metaphor
====================

In 1969 Xerox launched the Palo Alto Research Center (commonly referred to as PARC) to investigate future computing technologies, poaching Alan Kay from the University of Utah in 1970[IG54]. Many of Douglas Englebart’s colleagues from the Stanford Research Institute also joined the team in the early 1970s, bringing with them the aspirations of the NLS.

Englebart’s NLS and Kay’s FLEX both had the original idea of windows, which was clearly a revolutionary concept, but the informationscape was a blank canvas; beyond connecting our spacial understanding of the world with how we could interact with computers, it was unclear to what extent interfaces could be analogous to real life.

Kay’s team came about the concept of overlapping windows naturally due to the small real-estate of the screen but Bruner’s model suggested contrasting ideas[UIAPV129]. The iconic mentality would tend towards having as much information on the screen simultaneously as possible, allowing more room for cross-information problem solving and preventing the obstruction of having to navigate between material. Meanwhile the symbolic mentality encouraged parallels between interacting with the screen content and how we would interact with the same content in real life; an organised desk would have papers in stacks rather than scattered across it[AKTCC]. The is was the origin of the desktop metaphor[IG61].

At the time of text-based interfaces computers had ‘modes’, where keys had different meanings according to which mode you were in. There was an ‘insert’ mode for writing text and an ‘edit’ mode for navigating through the text with the same keys (the closest to a mode we have now would be CapsLock). Modes were necessary because there were no other methods of navigation, but since the advent of the mouse that didn’t have to be a problem.

Kay defined modeless as ‘the user could always get to the next thing desired without any backing out’[UIAPV129], and since overlapping windows vastly improved ease of navigation it was a win for both symbolic and iconic mentalities. The text-based command syntax of existing systems seemed enormously cumbersome compared to the ease of using a mouse to cycle between windows. This led to Kay’s belief that modes, on the whole, were stifling interaction, and the team worked towards removing modes in as many areas as they could.

Inspired by Logo and Simula, a language developed in 1965 for modelling manufacturing systems[AKTTC], the Smalltalk language was built to be object-oriented. Object-oriented programming is a paradigm based around discreet objects with attributes and functions (called methods). In order to make objects modeless the team at PARC invented drop-down menus – simply put, when an object is clicked it displays a list of things that it can do.

In the efforts to de-mode the computer Kay found text-editing to be the most challenging.
